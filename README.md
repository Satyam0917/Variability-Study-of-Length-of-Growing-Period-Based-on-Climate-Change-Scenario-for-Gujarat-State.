# Variability-Study-of-Length-of-Growing-Period-Based-on-Climate-Change-Scenario-for-Gujarat-State.
The length of  the  growing season  in any  given  region represents  the  number of  days when plant growth takes place. Knowledge  on the  date of  onset of rains  helps  to plan the agricultural  operations  better,  particularly,  land  preparation  and  sowing.  The  ‘length  of  the  rainy  season’  is  the duration  between the  onset and  end of  agriculturally  significant  rains.  The LGP depends not only on the rainfall distribution but also  on the type of soil, soil depth, water retention, release  characteristics  of the  soil,  air  temperatures  and  daylight  hours. Water balance can be defined as how much water is preserved in a water catchment area by considering how much water flows in and out of the watershed. Thornthwaite and Mather proposed a method that has become one of the most widely used methods to compute the balance nowadays
